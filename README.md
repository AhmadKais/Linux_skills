I have Downloaded pop!_os linux distribution ,since its based of ubuntu i dont see any problem , i tried installing ubuntu about a month ago andfailed and then i tried downloadeing Debian but found it more complicated , then found out that pop!_os is a begginer friendly distro.
the downloading steps are like that : 
first you download the distro on a USB flash drive .
then you restart your PC but when yousee the PC's logo you press F2 button to enter the BIOS , change the system boot steps to enter the pop!_os
, now you will download the , you have two options I to delete every thing on your PC or to give this new OS part of your hard disk and save all your info .
after downloading  the new operating system you can remove  the USB flash drive and here now you have two operating systems on your PC.
