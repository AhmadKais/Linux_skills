# Module 2:
in ti fursa_files directory i create two new empty directories , new_dir and new_dir2 using the mkdir command ,
i create two text files for each new directory then i move one of the files in 
new_dir to another directory new_dir2 and i try to move file4 to new_dir1 
but new_dir1 directory does not exist so what happens is that it changes the name of file4.txt to new_dir1 and moves it  to the current directory , then i fix the problem and change the files name back to file4 .

fg brings a background process to the foreground in a Unix shell, allowing interaction with it.
if we for example type sleep 100 we wont be able to use the terminal for 100 seconds but if we type sleep 100& then we will be able to use the terminal because the command is runnug in the background , the jobs comand lists running commands and fg%1 brings the first process to the foreground

# Module 5:

searching for a package
![searching valgrind](https://github.com/AhmadKais/Linux_skills/blob/main/downloading%20packeges%20valgrind.png)

installing valgrind using apt package manager , valgrind detecs memory leaks  
![downloading valgrind](https://github.com/AhmadKais/Linux_skills/blob/main/downloading%20valgrind.png)

updating and upgrading the OS
![sudo update upgrade](https://github.com/AhmadKais/Linux_skills/blob/main/sudo%20upgrade%20update.png)

The command dpkg -l | grep valgrind in Linux lists installed packages (dpkg -l) and filters the output using grep to display only the lines containing "valgrind." This helps to identify if the package named "valgrind" is installed on the system and provides information about its status or version if it's present.

# Module 6 : 
if [ ! -d "$source_dir" ]; then: This line checks if the source directory specified by source_dir variable (/home/kais/Desktop/Fursa_Files/new_dir1) exists and is a directory (-d). If it doesn't exist (! -d), it displays an error message and exits the script with exit code 1.

if [ ! -d "$destination_dir" ]; then: This part checks if the destination directory specified by destination_dir variable (/home/kais/Desktop/Fursa_Files/new_dir2) exists. If it doesn't exist, it creates the directory using mkdir -p.
for file in "$source_dir"/*; do: This loop iterates through each file in the source directory.

if [ -f "$file" ]; then: Inside the loop, this checks if the current item ($file) is a regular file (-f). If it is, the script copies the file from the source directory to the destination directory, renaming it with the timestamped prefix using cp.
    echo "Copied $(basename "$file") to $destination_dir": Displays a message indicating which file was copied.

# Module 7 :
the script of module 7 : 
# System Health Check Script

This Bash script (`module7.sh`) performs a comprehensive health check on a system, logging various aspects of system status and potential issues.

### Purpose
- **Health Checks**: The script covers essential system health checks including service status, disk usage, file system status, process information, failed SSH login attempts, and open ports.
- **Logging**: It logs the results of these checks into a specified log file (`system_health_check_log.txt`) along with timestamps.

### Usage
1. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in a terminal: `./module7.sh`.
2. **Log File**: The script generates a log file named `system_health_check_log.txt` to store the health check results.

### Script Breakdown
- **Log File Initialization**: Defines the log file to store script activities.
- **Clear Old Log Information**: Clears old log information by truncating the log file.
- **Logging Function (`log()`)**: A function to log output with a timestamp to the specified log file.
- **Health Check Functions**: Separate functions to perform various health checks.
- **Main Function (`run_health_checks`)**: Executes all health check functions and logs any errors encountered during execution.

### How to Use
1. **Save Script**: Save the script file (`module7.sh`) to your system.
2. **Make Executable**: Use `chmod +x module7.sh` to make the script executable.
3. **Run Script**: Execute the script using `./module7.sh` in a terminal.

### Example Output
- The script generates a log file with detailed information about the system's health status. Sample output might include service statuses, disk usage warnings, process information, failed login attempts, and open ports.

### Note
- Customize the script or add additional checks as per your system's requirements.
